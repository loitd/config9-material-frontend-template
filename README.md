# Why did I make this?
I am a Python/NodeJS Fullstack Developer searching for a good, modern, lightweight and fast frontend framework for my next and future projects. Unfortunately, I found that Google Material Design is what I need but I couldn't find any template suits my need. So I grab a [Starter Template](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) from [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com) and modify it myown to adapt my needs and call it CMFT (Config9 Material FrontEnd Template).

Feel free to use CMFT in your projects. I am happy if it could help you someway.
